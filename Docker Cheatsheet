Docker PS: PS(process status)
The docker ps command is used to list all the currently running containers on a Docker host. 
When you run this command, Docker will query the Docker daemon and return a list of all the containers that are currently running.

What does this command do?
docker run -p 3000:3000 2e8c64aaf7a38dd7467763b6396d087ffe0d413b4aa3e97088703b8501a89c31 
Answer: The command is used to start a Docker container from an image identified by the image ID 
2e8c64aaf7a38dd7467763b6396d087ffe0d413b4aa3e97088703b8501a89c31.

The -p option specifies that the container's port 3000 should be exposed and mapped to the host machine's port 3000, 
allowing you to access the application running inside the container from your web browser or other applications.

Assuming the container is running a web application that listens on port 3000, 
you should be able to access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

Note that the output of the docker run command may include logs or other information printed by the application running inside the container. 
If you want to view these logs, you can use the docker logs <container_id> command.

----Working with Images----
docker images - List all available images on the local Docker host.
docker pull <image_name> - Download a specific image from a Docker registry.
docker build -t <image_name> <dockerfile_path> - Build a Docker image using a Dockerfile.
docker tag <image_id> <new_tag> - Create a new tag for an existing Docker image.
docker push <image_name> - Upload an image to a Docker registry.


----Working with Containers----
docker run <image_name> - Create a new container from an image and start it.
docker ps - List all running containers on the local Docker host.
docker stop <container_id> - Stop a running container.
docker start <container_id> - Start a stopped container.
docker restart <container_id> - Restart a running container.
docker rm <container_id> - Remove a stopped container.
docker exec <container_id> <command> - Run a command inside a running container.


----Managing Docker Resources----
docker network ls - List all available Docker networks on the local host.
docker network create <network_name> - Create a new Docker network.
docker volume ls - List all available Docker volumes on the local host.
docker volume create <volume_name> - Create a new Docker volume.
docker system df - Show disk usage of Docker resources on the local host.
docker system prune - Remove unused Docker resources (images, containers, volumes, and networks).
